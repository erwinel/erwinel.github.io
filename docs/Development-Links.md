# Development Utility Links

- [Plunker - Helping you build the web (plnkr.co)](https://plnkr.co/) - Create and test web code on the fly.
  - [StackBlitz | Instant Dev Environments | Click. Code. Done.](https://stackblitz.com/) - An alternative to Plunker that some people prefer.
- [AngularJS: API: API Reference](https://docs.angularjs.org/api) - Documentation for AngularJS. There's a "Learn" button at the top with a tutorial link that goes into depth.
  - [AngularJS Tutorial (w3schools.com)](https://www.w3schools.com/angular/default.asp) - Another tutorial for Angular that many people find more helpful as a starting point.
  - ServiceNow uses version 1.8.2, which was the last version that was released.
  - **Note on Angular:** There is another JavaScript framework simply called "Angular", which is the successor to AngularJS. On Plunker and StackBlitz, they have ready-made starter templates for Angular, but most of them are not AngularJS.
    - This makes things a little more complicated, but back in the day, AngularJS was just called "Angular". If it is called "Angular", and the version number is 1, then it's actually AngularJS. Version 2.0 and higher are for the new Angular framework.
- [Bootstrap Version 3.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/) - This is the Bootstrap version that ServiceNow uses.
  - [Service Portal styles (servicenow.com)](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/tokyo-servicenow-platform/page/build/service-portal/concept/portal-css.html) - Documentation on how ServiceNow uses Bootstrap and CSS in general
  - [getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com/) - From the main Bootstrap website, you can select other versions. If you do any development outside of ServiceNow (which is probably likely in the long run), we'll probably be using the latest Bootstrap versions.
- [Diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) - Create or modify SVG graphic images that cleanly adapt to various sizes (versus jpegs, gifs and pngs).
- [HTML Color Picker](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp) - Online color picker with other useful tools relating to colors.
- [IP Subnet Calculator](https://www.dan.me.uk/ipsubnets) - Can be useful for configuring [Discovery](./Discovery.md).
