# Managing Global Update Sets

## Naming Convention

### New Update Sets

The names of new update sets should end with the date on which they were created (in yyyy-MM-dd format), followed by the developer's initials.

The first part of the name should either indicate the general purpose of the update set. This can be simple descriptive wording, or it can refer to things such as a specific sprint, task, request item or incident that it resolves.

### Merged Update sets

Merged update sets should follow the same naming convention as new update sets, except that they do not need to include the developer's initials.
