    <div class="card-body">
        The purpose of this application is to allow group name references to be agnostic between SDLC instances.

            <div class="card-header"><h3>Justification</h3></div>
            <div class="card-body">
                In a ServiceNow SDLC environment which synchronizes ServiceNow user groups with other sources, such as Active Directory Integration, it is possible that
                groups of the same name can have different <var>sys_id</var> on each of the development, test and production instances. If a workflow is created on
                the development server with a Group Approval node, the node can fail when pushed to test and/or production. This requires the workflow to be modified
                on the test and production servers, to select the approval group again.
                <h4>Complications of modifying workflows in Test/UAT and Production</h4>
                A potential conflict can arise if a workflow is modified in Test/UAT and/or Production, and then the workflow needs to be updated later from the development
                instance. If any modification dates in the update set occur between the time when the update set was completed and the time when any modifications occur
                in the other instance, then it will become excessively cumbersome to get the new update set to succeed.

            <div class="card-header"><h3>The Solution</h3></div>
            <div class="card-body">
                This application allows a list of commonly known group names to be defined by the system administrator.
                The workflow developer can then utilize this solution to populate group approval nodes by group name, rather than by the <var>sys_id</var>.
